The national resources pages below provide a general overview of resources, tools, and data related to the management of infectious disease data in a given country. Given the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many of the resources featured on the pages are centered around COVID-19. However, the practices, regulations, and other resources can be repurposed for use with other pathogens.
