## Introduction

Human clinical and health data comprise all data related to the health of an individual or population. Most often, these data are produced when an individual interacts with the health care system by going to the doctor, being hospitalized or buying medication at the pharmacy. 
These data are beneficial at individual level, but may also benefit the broader population: 
* When health data are used to treat the individual of which the data were collected, this is called the primary use of health data. 
* When health data are used outside the primary care of the individual, the term secondary use of health data is applied. 

The latter is especially important for adequate policy responses during (future) infectious disease outbreaks and to take well informed public health measures when and where necessary.

## What is considered as human clinical and health data?

Health data can be defined as ‘Personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status’ ([HealthyCloud Glossary](https://zenodo.org/record/6787119#.Y007u3ZBxPY)). Health data include environmental, socioeconomic, and behavioral information that affect the health and wellbeing of an individual as well as clinical data. The latter comprises clinical reports and individual patient data which are collected during the ongoing care of a patient or throughout clinical trial programs (references [1](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/external-guidance-implementation-european-medicines-agency-policy-publication-clinical-data_en-3.pdf); [2](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/hsl/data/findclin)).

Based on how the data are collected, a range of different data sources can be identified, such as:
* Lab/Biomarkers data 
* Mortality data
* Pharmacy data
* Hospital data
* Claims data
* Survey data 
* Electronic medical and health records
* Disease registries
* Consumer data

## Topic 1 <!--- Subsection related to a specific topic related to the data sources of the category that you selected.--->

Short explanation of what this topic is about and why it is important, with an emphasis on infectious diseases and the category that you selected.

### Considerations

Using a bullet point style list format as much as possible, describe the considerations for your topic that are specific to infectious diseases within the category (e.g. pathogen characterisation) that you have selected.

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases, here. Add links to RDMkit in the metadata above, if any are needed. 

### Standards, schemas, ontologies and vocabularies <!--- (optional) --->

List of standards, schemas, ontologies and/or vocabularies that are relevant to the resources in this category. Consider having links to the "Data description" page.
When applicable, consider adding the appropriate FAIRsharing entry to the tools and resources spreadsheet so that they can be listed and appropriately tagged at the end of the page

### Licenses <!--- (optional) --->

Under what licenses do the data sources work?

### Related data sources

Using bullet point list style as much as possible, describe when, why and for what purpose a specific data source should be used.

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases, here.

Avoid making long lists of links to data sources.

The data sources inserted in this section do not have to be considered a 'final' or 'perfect' solution, but should be something that is used by the wider community working in this area or topic.

Make sure to add the data sources mentioned in the text in the main "tools and resources" table.
